# yado-aws

An AWS design for the Yado homelab services, written as Terraform.

> **Status: prototype.** This repository is a full AWS design for the Yado
> services (launcher, SSO, shared PostgreSQL), written as Terraform and
> checked with static analysis (`fmt`, `validate`, `tflint`, Checkov), cost
> estimation (Infracost) and a local AWS emulator. **It has not been deployed
> to a live AWS account.** The applications themselves run on my own Proxmox
> homelab; this project shows how I would migrate and operate them on AWS.

## What is real and what is not

| Layer | Status |
|---|---|
| Application containers (yado, sso, malas) | Real, running on the homelab |
| PostgreSQL | Real, self-hosted (one bundled instance per service today) |
| Terraform modules in this repo | Written for real AWS, statically checked |
| AWS API calls | Rehearsed against a local emulator with partial coverage |
| Cost figures | Estimated from pricing data, never billed |

## What it models

Yado is a small family of services behind `*.yado.my.id`: a Next.js launcher
and status page, a Laravel + Passport OAuth2 identity provider (SSO), and
other apps that sign in through it. Today they run as Docker containers in one
Proxmox LXC, published through a Cloudflare Tunnel.

This repo answers: *what would it take to run that on AWS, and what would
that fix?*

```
Route 53 + ACM  ->  ALB (host-based routing)  ->  ECS Fargate services
                                                   |- yado   (Next.js)
                                                   |- sso    (php-fpm + nginx sidecar)
                                                   '- (malas, planned)
                                              ->  one shared RDS PostgreSQL
                                                   (db_sso, db_malas, one role each)
Secrets Manager, S3 (app storage), ECR, CloudWatch alarms + dashboard, SNS
```

## Findings from the homelab, and the AWS answer

These come from a real review of the running setup, not a template.

| Finding on the homelab | Design answer here |
|---|---|
| No scheduled PostgreSQL backups | RDS automated backups, final snapshot on destroy, restore test (docs/migration.md) |
| SSO was down about two weeks with no alert (Oct 2026) | `RunningTaskCount` alarm that treats missing data as breaching, ALB health checks, ECS restarts failed tasks automatically (docs/failure-drill.md) |
| Host-level management access relies on network trust | No daemon to expose; deploys and operations go through IAM |
| Secrets in per-server `.env` files | Secrets Manager injected at task start; generated DB passwords; app secrets never in git |
| Three Postgres containers, one of them unused | One shared RDS instance with a database and least-privilege role per service |
| Manual `git pull` + `docker compose up` deploys | Immutable image tags, rolling deploys with circuit breaker and automatic rollback |
| Tunnel routes exist only in a dashboard | Hostname routing defined as code |
| Local volumes for uploads and storage | S3 bucket, per-service IAM prefix |

## Repository layout

```
modules/
  network/      VPC, public + private subnets, security groups, flow logs
  alb/          Route 53 zone, ACM wildcard cert, ALB, HTTPS listener
  ecs-service/  Reusable Fargate service: task def, SG, target group, rule
  rds/          Shared PostgreSQL 16, private, encrypted, RDS-managed master secret
  db-init/      One-off task that creates per-service roles and databases
  secrets/      Generated DB credentials + empty app-secret containers
  iam/          Execution role and least-privilege task roles
  ecr/          Immutable-tag repositories with scan on push
  storage/      Private versioned S3 bucket
  monitoring/   SNS topic, alarms, dashboard
envs/prototype/ Wires the modules together
emulation/      Local AWS emulator for rehearsal
docs/           Architecture, cost, migration, failure drill
```

## Using it

```bash
cd envs/prototype
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars   # edit domain_name

terraform init
terraform validate
terraform plan                                  # needs AWS credentials, or:
terraform plan -var use_emulator=true           # against the local emulator
```

Do not run `apply` against a real account unless you understand the cost:
the ALB, RDS instance and Fargate tasks bill hourly. Set an AWS Budget alert
first and run `terraform destroy` when finished.

## Deliberate prototype tradeoffs

- **No NAT gateway.** Fargate tasks sit in public subnets with a public IP,
  but accept traffic only from the ALB security group. A NAT gateway costs
  more per month than the rest of the stack's compute.
- **Single-AZ RDS.** Multi-AZ doubles the database cost; the switch is one
  variable (`db_multi_az`).
- **Local Terraform state.** An S3 backend example is provided
  (`envs/prototype/backend.tf.example`). Generated DB passwords live in state,
  so a real deployment needs an encrypted, private bucket.
- **Destroy-friendly.** Deletion protection is off and secrets are removed
  immediately so the stack can be torn down cleanly.

See `docs/` for the reasoning behind each choice.
